# spicebook
Source Code for my CISC 4900 project Spicebook

This site was made for a term project.
It uses:
- HTML with EJS
- Bootstrap 5
- Node.JS
- Express
- Many other NPM modules
- MongoDB

Here's the site link: https://enigmatic-fortress-98494.herokuapp.com/ (It will probably be down).

Here's my REALLY REALLY REALLY awkward video presentation of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGt1SOWjXqc (in case the site's down).

NOTE: THERE IS NO TRUE ACCOUNT SYSTEM IN TERMS OF GETTING AN EMAIL, I ASK TO NOT SIGN UP AS THIS IS A MOCK SITE, NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS A LIVE SERVICE
